# ðŸ–‹ Product Sales Campaign ðŸ–¨



This project was my final practical exam for my [Data Analyst Professional certification](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DA0028664290129) with Python and SQL at DataCamp.

## Synopsis ðŸ“‹

**Pens and Printers** was founded in 1984 as a brick-and-mortar wholesale supply company. Its business is reselling high-quality office products to large organizations, i.e. it operates in the Business-to-Business (B2B) segment.

Pens and Printers distributes a wide range of premium office supplies â€” from small stationery accessories through office furniture to computer hardware. 

Pens and Printers adapted to the changing business environment by branching into online services. The company added an e-commerce website to its distribution channels to better serve its customers, as it realized that many businesses procure their office supplies in new ways. 

Pens and Printers is aware that its sales strategies need to adopt new tactics to better address the evolving purchase behavior of its clients.

## Objective :dart:

Six weeks ago Pens and Printers launched a new product line of office stationery. 

Launching a new product line incurs high expenses and the company is looking for the best techniques to sell the new products most cost-effectively.

For the new product line launch Pens and Printers applied three different sales strategies to three different customer groups.

| Sales Strategy | Execution | Time and Effort |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| **targeted email** | one email sent at product launch,<br/> a follow-up email three weeks later | requires very little work from the sales team |
| **phone call** | phone call by a sales representative | average phone call duration: <br/>30 minutes per customer |
| **email and phone call** | one email sent at product launch, <br/>a follow-up phone call by a sales representative a week later | email requires very little effort; <br/>average follow-up phone call duration: <br/>10 minutes per customer |

<br/>

This data analysis aims at answering the following questions about Pens and Printers' latest sales campaign:

* _How many customers were there for each sales approach?_
* _What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?_
* _Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the sales methods?_
* _Based on the data (time, effort, results per sales strategy), which method would you recommend we continue to use?_
* _Provide context about customer groups, an overview of what is going on, and what to do next._
