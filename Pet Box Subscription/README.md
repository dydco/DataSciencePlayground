# Pet Box Subscription ðŸ“¦ 



This project was my final practical exam for my [Data Analyst Associate certification](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DAA0014151997793) with SQL at DataCamp.

<br/>

## Synopsis :clipboard:

PetMind is a nationwide pet product retailer in the United States. With inflation hitting 41-year highs, the company is planning to reduce the cost of customer retention by improving brand loyalty. The first strategy is to launch a monthly pet box subscription in three months. The marketing team is preparing a list of popular products for the pet box subscription. The chief marketing officer wants to know whether the list should only include the products being purchased more than once.

<br/>

## Objective :dart:

The marketing team would like to answer the following questions to help with the decision:

* _How many products are being purchased more than once?_
* _Do the products being purchased again have better sales than others?_
* _What products are more likely to be purchased again for different types of pets?_
